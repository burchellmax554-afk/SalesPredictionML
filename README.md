This project explores how different factors influence global video game sales using real- world data and machine learning techniques. The analysis begins
with an examination of features such as release year, user ratings, average player counts, genre, and platform, with the goal of identifying which 
variables most strongly impact a game’s commercial success. Initial attempts using linear regression showed poor predictive performance due to the 
complexity and nonlinear nature of the dataset, motivating the use of more advanced models.

A Random Forest regression model was implemented to better capture nonlinear relationships within the data. This approach produced significantly stronger
results and clear insights, revealing that average player count and user ratings have the strongest correlation with sales, followed by release year. The 
repository includes the full analysis notebook, the dataset, and documentation of earlier modeling attempts for transparency. This project demonstrates a
machine learning workflow, from exploratory analysis and model selection to evaluation and interpretation of results.
